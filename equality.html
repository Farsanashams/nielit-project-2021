   <p>  Equality is about ensuring that every individual has an equal opportunity to make the most of their lives and talents. 

      It is also the belief that no one should have poorer life chances because of the way they were born, where they come from,
       what they believe, or whether they have a disability.
      </p> 
    <p>  Equality recognises that historically certain groups of people with protected characteristics such as race, disability,
       sex and sexual orientation have experienced discrimination. 
      Equality’ is a contested concept: “People who praise it or disparage it disagree about what they are praising or disparaging” 
      (Dworkin 2000, p. 2). Our first task is therefore to provide a clear definition of equality in the face of widespread misconceptions 
      about its meaning as a political idea. The terms ‘equality’ (Greek: isotes; Latin: aequitas, aequalitas; French: égalité; German Gleichheit),
       ‘equal’, and ‘equally’ signify a qualitative relationship. ‘Equality’ (or ‘equal’) signifies correspondence between a group of different objects, 
       persons, processes or circumstances that have the same qualities in at least one respect, but not all respects, i.e., regarding one specific
        feature, with differences in other features. ‘Equality’ must then be distinguished from ‘identity’, which refers to one and the same object 
        corresponding to itself in all its features. For the same reason, it needs to be distinguished from ‘similarity’ – the concept of merely
         approximate correspondence (Dann 1975, p. 997; Menne 1962, p. 44 ff.; Westen 1990, pp. 39, 120). Thus, to say that men are equal, for example,
          is not to say that they are identical. Equality implies similarity rather than ‘sameness’.</p>

   <p>   Judgements of equality presume a difference between the things compared. According to this definition, the notion of ‘complete’ or ‘absolute’ 
      equality may be seen as problematic because it would violate the presumption of a difference. Two non-identical objects are never completely
       equal; they are different at least in their spatiotemporal location. If things do not differ they should not be called ‘equal’, but rather,
        more precisely, ‘identical’, such as the morning and the evening star. Here usage might vary. Some authors do consider absolute qualitative 
        equality admissible as a borderline concept (Tugendhat & Wolf 1983, p. 170).</p>
      
   <p> ‘Equality’ can be used in the very same sense both to describe and prescribe, as with ‘thin’: “you are thin” and “you are too thin”. The approach 
      taken to defining the standard of comparison for both descriptive and prescriptive assertions of equality is very important (Oppenheim 1970). 
      In the descriptive case, the common standard is itself descriptive, for example when two people are said to have the same weight.
       In the prescriptive use, the standard prescribes a norm or rule, for example when it is said people ought to be equal before the law.
        The standards grounding prescriptive assertions of equality contain at least two components. On the one hand, there is a descriptive
         component, since the assertions need to contain descriptive criteria, in order to identify those people to which the rule or norm applies.
          The question of this identification – who belongs to which category? – may itself be normative, as when we ask to whom the U.S. laws apply.
           On the other hand, the comparative standards contain something normative – a moral or legal rule, such as the U.S. laws – specifying how 
           those falling under the norm are to be treated. Such a rule constitutes the prescriptive component (Westen 1990, chap. 3). Sociological
            and economic analyses of (in-)equality mainly pose the questions of how inequalities can be determined and measured and what their causes 
            and effects are. In contrast, social and political philosophy is in general concerned mainly with the following questions: what kind of 
             equality, if any, should obtain, and with respect to whom and when? Such is the case in this article as well.</p>
